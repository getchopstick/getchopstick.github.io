					Typography with Meaning
				</h2>
				<p>
					The era of digital typography has finally arrived. Almost every typeface is at our disposal for use on screen. But with great power comes great responsibility.
				</p>
				<p>
					Text contains hierarchy. And you want to <strong>create hierarchy in a hassle-free and meaningful way</strong>. Including the latest font is not enough. You want to find a way to incorperate the golden ratio in your headers and paragraph text. Chopstick gets you going with a little help from our friend <strong>modular scale</strong>.
				</p>
<div class="example"><pre><code class="language-css">.title {
	font-size: ms(3);
	// Up 3 steps in modular scale
}
</code></pre></div>

					Alzheimer-proof Boilerplate
				</h2>
				<p>
					Some things are required in every site you make. It can be a pain to remember what meta-tags, conditional comments or favicon files you need. Chopstick is delivered with some <strong>nice boilerplate files to kick-start your project.</strong> Like Alzeheimer&rsquo;s medicine.

					Remember we promised you zero kilobyte? All of these features are completely optional. <strong>If you do not need it, it will not be in your code.</strong> You have the freedom to use and abuse the framework to your benefit. You can use our complete wardrobe or choose to get completely naked!
